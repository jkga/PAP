Personal Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a secure authentication protocol for accessing protected
resources in a server including files, directory and accounts. It works by exchanging tokens to generate
unique key that will only work within a session under a limited permission. Server,
applications or any connected nodes must use the same algorithm to validate and generate hashes.

It is essential for authenticating server-server and application-server which nodes require a strict access
from outbound connection. It is best suitable for personal and enterprise in which closed authentication
is required.
